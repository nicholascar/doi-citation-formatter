# DOI Citation Formatter

A tiny JavaScript script to get and format an APA-stype citation from either a CrossRef or a DataCite DOI, using the CrossRef & DataCite APIs.

This has been made as there appear to be problems with the Datacite CrossCite API.

This code will eventually make its way into a Drupal module.
